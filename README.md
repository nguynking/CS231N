## About

### Overview

These are my solutions for the **CS231N** course assignments offered by _Stanford University_ (Spring 2023). Written questions are explained in detail, the code is brief and commented.

## Requirements
These assignments are suggested using **Google Colab** if you don't have any GPUs. All instructions for setting up a virtual environment are on the [**Course Notes**](https://cs231n.github.io/setup-instructions/) page.

> Note: Python 3.8 or newer should be used

## Solutions

### Structure

For every assignment, i.e., for directories `assigment1` through `assignment5`, there is coding and written parts. The `solutions.pdf` files are generated from latex directories where the provided templates were filled while completing the questions in `handout.pdf` files and the code.

### Assignments

* [**A1**](assignment1): Image Classification, kNN, SVM, Softmax, Fully Connected Neural Network
* [**A2**](assignment2): Fully Connected and Convolutional Nets, Batch Normalization, Dropout, Pytorch & Network Visualization
* [**A3**](assignment3): Network Visualization, Image Captioning with RNNs and Transformers, Generative Adversarial Networks, Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning
